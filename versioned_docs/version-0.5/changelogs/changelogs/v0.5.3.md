*  (rancherio-gh-m) released this 2023-03-06 15:56:56 +0000 UTC*


## Notes

Upgrading the Fleet helm chart upgrades the fleet-controller and its config. To avoid race conditions while fleet-controller starts updating the fleet-agents, we propose to scale down the fleet-controller to zero replicas before starting the upgrade.

When using Fleet in Rancher and updating from Rancher 2.5, the default installation namespace for fleet changes from fleet-system to cattle-fleet-system. This release adds code to re-deploy the agents if necessary, to regenerate their config in the new namespace. Once the new agent is running and the cluster resources status is ok, it's fine to delete any leftover fleet-system namespaces. In older versions of fleet, it's possible to https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40127#issuecomment-1379027121 into the new namespace, or to https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/40127#issuecomment-1381884485.
