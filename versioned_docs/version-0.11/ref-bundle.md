# Bundle Resource

Bundles are automatically created by Fleet when a `GitRepo` is created.

The content of the resource corresponds to the [BundleSpec](./ref-crds#bundlespec).
For more information on how to use the Bundle resource [Create a Bundle Resource](./bundle-add.md).

```yaml
kind: Bundle
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  # Any name can be used here
  name: my-bundle
  # For single cluster use fleet-local, otherwise use the namespace of
  # your choosing
  namespace: fleet-local
spec:
  # Namespace used for resources that do not specify a namespace.
  # This field is not used to enforce or lock down the deployment to a specific namespace.
  # defaultNamespace: test

  # If present will assign all resource to this
  # namespace and if any cluster scoped resource exists the deployment will fail.
  # targetNamespace: app

  # Kustomize options for the deployment, like the dir containing the kustomization.yaml file.
  # kustomize: ...

  # Helm options for the deployment, like the chart name, repo and values.
  # helm: ...

  # ServiceAccount which will be used to perform this deployment.
  # serviceAccount: sa

  # ForceSyncGeneration is used to force a redeployment.
  # forceSyncGeneration: 0

  # YAML options, if using raw YAML these are names that map to overlays/{name} that will be used to replace or patch a resource.
  # yaml: ...

  # Diff can be used to ignore the modified state of objects which are amended at runtime.
  # A specific commit or tag can also be watched.
  #
  # diff: ...

  # KeepResources can be used to keep the deployed resources when removing the bundle.
  # keepResources: false

  # If set to true, will stop any BundleDeployments from being updated. It will be marked as out of sync.
  # paused: false

  # Controls the rollout of bundles, by defining partitions, canaries and percentages for cluster availability.
  # rolloutStrategy: ...

  # Contain the actual resources from the git repo which will be deployed.
