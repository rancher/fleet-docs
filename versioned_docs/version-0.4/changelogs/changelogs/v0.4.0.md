*  (rancherio-gh-m) released this 2022-10-13 16:38:56 +0000 UTC*


## Additions

* Added the ability to utilize Helm _atomic_ when installing and upgrading.
* Added an RBAC rule for leases.coordination.k8s.io in the Gitjob chart.

_Note: due to an issue in the fleet agent, when a bundle fails to install properly the agent goes into a cycle of repeatedly trying to reinstall. This happens when **atomic** is set or there is an error with installing the bundle for another reason. This is the cause of issue #499 and is being worked on._

_Note: due to an issue in the fleet controller the presence of a clusterregistrationtoken resource can lead to a higher than normal CPU load. The token expiry time is not updated correctly. The [issue](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/pull/995) is fixed in the next version of fleet._

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the fleet agent can continuously delete resources

## Changes

* Added CI testing to Gitjob
* Updated dependencies (Go modules and base container images)
* Updated to a newer version of the Tekton components used by Fleet
* Updated builds to Go 1.18
* Updated the base container images to use SLE BCI
