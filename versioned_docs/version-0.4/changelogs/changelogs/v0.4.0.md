## Description


<h2>Additions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to utilize Helm <em>atomic</em> when installing and upgrading.</li>
<li>Added an RBAC rule for leases.coordination.k8s.io in the Gitjob chart.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: due to an issue in the fleet agent, when a bundle fails to install properly the agent goes into a cycle of repeatedly trying to reinstall. This happens when <strong>atomic</strong> is set or there is an error with installing the bundle for another reason. This is the cause of issue <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="978032156" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/499" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/rancher/fleet/issues/499/hovercard" href="https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/499">#499</a> and is being worked on.</em></p>
<p><em>Note: due to an issue in the fleet controller the presence of a clusterregistrationtoken resource can lead to a higher than normal CPU load. The token expiry time is not updated correctly.
