*  (rancherio-gh-m) released this 2023-11-07 12:30:45 +0000 UTC*


## Notes

Fleet 0.9 contains major [changes to Gitjob](https://github.com/rancher/gitjob/releases/tag/v0.1.96). The existing git handling code has been unified and now uses the go-git library. The tekton CLI, which was used for cloning, has been removed. The release improves the performance on downstream clusters, by using a caching client with the helm SDK.
