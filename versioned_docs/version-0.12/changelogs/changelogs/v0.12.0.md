*  (github-actions[bot]) released this 2025-03-24 14:21:20 +0000 UTC*


## Notes

This release adds a new HelmOps controller that allows you to manage Helm charts using the HelmApp CRD. This controller is experimental and is not enabled by default.

Several log messages have been improved to provide more context and information about the errors that occurred. The conditions in the status fields of resources are used by the UI to display warnings and we are continuously improving them.

When a bundle fails to deploy to a cluster, e.g. because the cluster is missing a required label that is to be used as a value, the bundle will now show the affected cluster in the error message. This makes it easier to identify which clusters are affected by the error.

The agent has been switched from a StatefulSet to a Deployment. This change allows the agent to scale horizontally and is a step towards making the agent more resilient to failures. The agent now exposes the number of worker goroutines it is running, which can be used to tune the agent's performance.
