# fleet.yaml

The `fleet.yaml` file adds options to a bundle. Any directory with a
`fleet.yaml` is automatically turned into bundle.

For more information on how to use the `fleet.yaml` to customize bundles see
[Git Repository Contents](./gitrepo-content.md).

The content of the fleet.yaml corresponds to the `FleetYAML` struct at
[pkg/apis/fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1/fleetyaml.go](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/blob/main/pkg/apis/fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1/fleetyaml.go),
which contains the [BundleSpec](./ref-crds#bundlespec).

### Helm Options

#### Main options

##### chart

This specifies a custom location for the Helm chart. This can refer to any go-getter URL or OCI registry based Helm
chart URL, e.g. `oci://ghcr.io/fleetrepoci/guestbook`.
This allows one to download charts from many different locations. go-getter URLs support adding a digest to validate the
download. If the `repo` field is set, this field is the name of the chart to lookup.

It is possible to download the chart from a Git repository, e.g. by using
`git@github.com:rancher/fleet-examples//single-cluster/helm`. If a secret for the SSH key was defined in the GitRepo via
`helmSecretName`, it will be injected into the chart URL.

:::note chart reference depending on `fleet.yaml` location
If a `fleet.yaml` file is located outside of an embedded chart's directory, then it must explicitly reference the chart
using a `helm.chart` field. Otherwise, Fleet will not install the chart.

This also means that if no `helm.chart` field is specified in such a case, then Helm-specific fields like `valuesFiles`
or `valuesFrom` will not have any effect.

It is not necessary to specify a chart's own `values.yaml` via `valuesFiles:`. It will always be used as a default when the agent installs the chart. See [Using Helm Values](./gitrepo-content#using-helm-values).

See [Using Helm Values](./gitrepo-content#using-helm-values) for more details.
:::note

:::warning Limitation: downloading Helm charts from git with custom CA bundles

Git repositories can be downloaded via unauthenticated http, by using for example:
`git::http://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/single-cluster/helm`.

However, this does not work with custom CA bundles at this point: if a CA bundle is configured in a secret referenced in
`helmSecretName`, will not be used, which will result in the git job displaying errors such as `SSL certificate problem:
unable to get local issuer certificate` when running `fleet apply` to generate a bundle.

See [fleet#3646](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/issues/3646) for more details.

:::

##### version

The version also determines which chart to download from OCI registries.

:::note `+` character support
OCI registries don't support the `+` character, which is supported by semver.  When pushing a Helm chart with a tag
containing the `+` character, Helm automatically replaces `+` with '_' before uploading it.

You should use the version with the `+` in `fleet.yaml`, as the `_` character is not supported by semver and Fleet also
replaces `+` with `_` when accessing the OCI registry.
:::

#### How fleet-agent deploys the bundle

These options also apply to kustomize- and manifest-style bundles.  They control
how the fleet-agent deploys the bundle. All bundles are converted into Helm
charts and deployed with the Helm SDK.  These options are often similar to the
Helm CLI options for install and update.

- releaseName
- takeOwnership
- force
- atomic
- disablePreProcess
- disableDNS
- skipSchemaValidation
- waitForJobs

#### Helm Chart Download Options

These options are for Helm-style bundles, they specify how to download the
chart.

- chart
- repo
- version

The reference to the chart can be either:

- a local path in the cloned Git repository, specified by `chart`.
- a [go-getter URL](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter?tab=readme-ov-file#url-format),
  specified by `chart`. This can be used to download a tarball
  of the chart. go-getter also allows to download a chart from a Git repo.
- OCI chart URL, specified by `chart`. This can be used to download a chart
  directly from a OCI server. It uses the Helm SDK to download the chart.
- a Helm repository, specified by `repo` and optionally `version`.
- an OCI Helm repository, specified by `repo` and optionally `version`.

#### Helm Chart Value Options

Options for the downloaded Helm chart.

- values
- valuesFiles
- valueFrom

### Values

Values are processed in different stages of the lifecycle: https://fleet.rancher.io/ref-bundle-stages

* fleet.yaml `values:` and `valuesFile:` are added to the bundle's values when it is created.
* helm values templating, e.g. with `${ }` happens when the bundle is targeted at a cluster, cluster labels filled in, etc.
* When the agent installs the chart, values from `valuesFrom` are read. Then Helm templating `{{ }}` is processed.

### Templating

It is possible to specify the keys and values as go template strings for
advanced templating needs.  Most of the functions from the [sprig templating
library](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) are available.
This can be turned off in `fleet.yaml`, by setting `disablePreProcess`, e.g. to
avoid conflicts with other templating languages.

Note that if the functions output changes with every call, e.g. `uuidv4`, the
bundle will get redeployed.

You can [test values templating with the CLI](./ref-bundle-stages#fleet-target) against existing clusters.

The template context has the following keys:

* `.ClusterValues` are retrieved from target cluster's `spec.templateValues`
* `.ClusterLabels` and `.ClusterAnnotations` are the labels and annotations in
  the cluster resource.
* `.ClusterName` as the fleet's cluster resource name.
* `.ClusterNamespace` as the namespace in which the cluster resource exists.

To access Labels or Annotations by their key name:

```
${ get .ClusterLabels "management.cattle.io/cluster-display-name" }
```

Note: The fleet.yaml must be valid yaml. Templating uses `${ }` as delims,
unlike Helm which uses `{{ }}`.  These fleet.yaml template delimiters can be
escaped using backticks, eg.:

```
foo-bar-${`${PWD}`}
```

will result in the following text:

```
foo-bar-${PWD}
```

:::warning empty values
It is easier to use `global.fleet.clusterLabels.LABELNAME` instead of templating. When using templating, make sure to protect against null values.

Example:
```
${ if hasKey .ClusterLabels "LABELNAME" }${ .ClusterLabels.LABELNAME }${ else }missing${ end}
```
